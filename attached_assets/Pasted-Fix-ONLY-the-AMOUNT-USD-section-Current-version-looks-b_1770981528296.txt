Fix ONLY the “AMOUNT (USD)” section. Current version looks broken because the summary is not on-grid and the font sizing/spacing is inconsistent. Implement the below EXACT specs.

GOAL (must satisfy)
- Amount input stays clean (USD only).
- Show (a) Total INR, (b) Post-discount rate, and optionally (c) Original rate (struck) — all aligned to the same grid.
- No element should look “floating” or off-grid on desktop or mobile.

A) LAYOUT (responsive grid)
1) Wrap the amount input + summary in a single container .amountRow
2) Desktop/tablet (>=768px):
   - Use CSS GRID:
     grid-template-columns: minmax(260px, 1fr) minmax(220px, 280px);
     column-gap: 16px;
     align-items: center;
3) Small screens (<768px):
   - Stack:
     grid-template-columns: 1fr;
     row-gap: 10px;
   - Summary goes BELOW input and becomes left-aligned.

B) INPUT FIELD
- Label: “AMOUNT (USD)”
- Input width: 100%
- Input min-height: 56px
- Font-size: 22px; font-weight: 700
- Border radius: 10px
- Do NOT render any rate/total text inside the input container.

C) SUMMARY BLOCK (right column) — show EXACTLY 2 rows
Use a summary block with two lines so it doesn’t look messy.

Row 1 (Rate line):
- Text: “Rate: ₹{post_discount_rate}/USD”
- If original rate exists and is higher:
  show “₹{original_rate}/USD” struck-through BEFORE the post rate (same line).
  Example:
  Rate: ₹91.26/USD (struck)  ₹91.12/USD
- Styling:
  font-size: 13px
  line-height: 18px
  color: muted grey
  post-discount rate should be slightly darker than muted (but still smaller than total)

Row 2 (Total line) — PRIMARY
- Text: “Total: ₹{final_total_inr}”
  (use “Total” instead of “You pay” if you prefer; but keep it consistent)
- Styling:
  font-size: 24px (desktop), 22px (mobile)
  font-weight: 800
  line-height: 30px
  color: primary navy/black
- Keep “Total: ₹xx” on ONE line on desktop (use nowrap)
- On mobile, allow wrap only if absolutely needed.

Alignment:
- Desktop: summary block is right-aligned (text-align:right) and vertically centered with input.
- Mobile: summary block is left-aligned.

D) SPACING + GRID CONSISTENCY (important)
- The summary block must start on the same horizontal baseline grid as the input (no negative margins).
- Add padding-top: 2px to summary if needed for optical alignment, but avoid manual offsets.

E) REMOVE/AVOID THESE IN AMOUNT SECTION
- Do NOT show struck-through TOTAL INR (old total). Only show original rate (optional) and post-discount rate.
- Do NOT show cashback/coupon “Copy code” inside this Amount section.

ACCEPTANCE CHECK
- Desktop: input and summary sit in one row; “Total” is prominent; rate is small above it; everything aligns cleanly.
- Mobile: label -> input -> summary (rate then total), no overlap, no off-grid spacing.

Implement as HTML/CSS changes only in the Amount block; keep rest of widget unchanged.
